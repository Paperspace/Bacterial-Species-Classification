## Dataset

Using variations of ResNet Architectures to classify species and genera of bacteria. The model achieved around 98% accuracy, competing and even beating published State of the Art models. The Fastai library was used, and one cycle training was performed with each network.

This project made use of the Digital Image of Bacterial Species, found here: http://misztal.edu.pl/software/databases/dibas/ . There are 33 classes of bacteria with around 20 examples each.
